    <p>Turns out lovely and crispy. Perfect for any day of the week!</p>
      <p>
        Classic waffles are a beloved breakfast staple that have been enjoyed
        for generations. They are made by pouring a batter made from eggs,
        flour, sugar, and milk onto a hot waffle iron, then cooking until golden
        brown and crispy. The result is a fluffy, tender waffle with a crisp
        exterior that is perfect for topping with butter, syrup, fruit, or
        whipped cream. Classic waffles are a simple yet satisfying breakfast
        option, and are a great way to start the day with a warm and delicious
        meal. Whether you enjoy them plain or topped with your favorite sweet or
        savory ingredients, classic waffles are sure to be a crowd-pleaser.
