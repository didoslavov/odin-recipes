      <p>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
          baking dish.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Mix butter, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, poppy seeds, and
          dried onion in a bowl.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Separate the tops from the bottoms of the rolls; arrange the bottom
          pieces in a layer in the prepared baking dish. Layer about 1/2 of the
          ham onto the rolls; add a layer of Swiss cheese and top with remaining
          ham slices.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Place the tops of the rolls onto the sandwiches. Pour mustard mixture
          evenly over the rolls.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until the rolls are lightly browned and the
          cheese has melted, about 20 minutes. Slice into individual rolls
          through the ham and cheese layers to serve.
        </li>
